Indeed, if all of the directions are reversed then this yields a rewriting
framework for categories with a cocartesian structure. However, adding both the
Cartesian and cocartesian structure would yield 'pure' hypergraphs which
additionally admit the equations of a Frobenius algebra, so this approach cannot
be used for biproducts.

We intend to apply traced DPO for the case study of digital circuits mentioned
in Sec. 6.2 of the paper and detailed more in [15]. Here, the fixpoint equations
are handled using the 'unfolding' rule that holds in any traced Cartesian
category (see e.g. [15, Lem. 10]). This can be applied in the traced DPO setting
by using the DPO rules shown in Figure 2: the rest of the equations required are
axioms of STMCs so are absorbed into the hypergraph notation.
