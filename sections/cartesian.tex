\subsection{Cartesian structure}

One important class of categories with a traced comonoid structure are
\emph{traced Cartesian categories}~\cite{cazanescu1990new,hasegawa1997recursion}.
These categories are interesting because any traced Cartesian
category admits a fixpoint operator~\cite[Thm. 3.1]{hasegawa1997recursion}.

\begin{definition}[Cartesian category~\cite{fox1976coalgebras}]
    A monoidal category is \emph{Cartesian} if its tensor is given by the
    Cartesian product.
\end{definition}

As a result of this, the unit is a terminal object in any Cartesian category,
and any object becomes a comonoid.
The notion of (traced) Cartesian categories can also be expressed as a monoidal
theory:

\begin{definition}
    For a given base prop \(\stmc{\Sigma_\mathbf{C}}\) with a comonoid
    structure, the monoidal theory \((
        \generators[\mathbf{Cart}_\mathbf{C}],
        \equations[\mathbf{Cart}_\mathbf{C}]
    )\) is defined with \(
        \generators[\mathbf{Cart}_\mathbf{C}] := \Sigma_\mathbf{C}
    \) and \(
        \equations[\mathbf{Cart}_\mathbf{C}]
    \) as the equations in \cref{fig:cartesian-equations}.
\end{definition}

As the equations in \(\equations[\mathbf{Cart}_\mathbf{C}]\) are parameterised
over any morphism \(\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[F][white][m][n]\), a separate
DPO rewrite rule is required for every combination of generators: an example is
also shown in \(\cref{fig:cartesian-equations}\).

\begin{remark}
    A naive attempt to define a finite set of Cartesian rewrite rules might be
    to imagine the edge as `syntax sugar' for a subgraph, but this also has
    nuance: what do the vertices in the interface mean if the subgraph is just a
    single vertex, for example?
    One possible solution would be to formalise this using the
    \emph{hierarchical hypergraphs} of~\cite{alvarez-picallo2022rewriting} to
    replace the concrete generator edge with a single edge representing an
    arbitrary subgraph, but this remains as future work.
\end{remark}
