\label{app:equations}

Equations that hold in any symmetric traced monoidal category are listed in
\cref{fig:stmc-axioms}.
These axioms were originally presented in~\cite{joyal1996traced}: an additional
vanishing axiom was originally also included but it was shown in
\cite{hasegawa2009traced} that this was redundant.
Equations that hold in any compact closed category are listed in
\cref{fig:ccc-axioms}.

Equations for commutative monoids are listed in \cref{fig:monoid-equations}.
Equations for cocommutative comonoids are listed in \cref{fig:comonoid-equations}.
Equations for special commutative Frobenius algebras are listed in
\cref{fig:frobenius-equations}.
Equations for hypergraph categories are listed in \cref{fig:hypergraph-category}.
Equations for bialgebras are listed in \cref{fig:bialgebra-equations}.

Equations in the monoidal theory of gate-level sequential circuits are listed in
\cref{fig:circuit-equations}.
These include the equations of a \emph{bialgebra}, which themselves include the
equations of a commutative comonoid.
