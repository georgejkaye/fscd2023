\section{Graph rewriting}

While we can reason about terms in a monoidal category with \emph{equations},
we can reason using hypergraphs with \emph{graph rewrites}.

\begin{definition}[Rewrite rule]
    Given interfaced hypergraphs \(
        \cospan{i}[a_1]{L}[a_2]{j}
    \) and \(
        \cospan{i}[b_1]{R}[b_2]{j}
    \), their rewrite rule is a span in \(\hypsigma\): \(
        \spann{L}[[a_1,a_2]]{i+j}[[b_1,b_2]]{R}
    \).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[DPO]\label{def:dpo}
    \begin{gather}
        \label{gath:dpo}
        \includestandalone{figures/graphs/dpo/dpo}
    \end{gather}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[\cite{bonchi2022string}, Definition 3.16]
    Let \(K \xrightarrow{i} L \xrightarrow{m} G\) be morphisms in \(\hypsigma\).
    They satisfy the \emph{no-dangling} condition if, for every hyperedge \(e\)
    not in the image of \(m\), every node of its source and target is either in
    not in the image of \(m\) or in the image of \(i \seq m\).

    They satisfy the \emph{no-identification} condition if, for any two distinct
    vertices \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) such that \(m(v_1) = m(v_2)\), \(v_1\) and
    \(v_2\) are in the image of \(i\).
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[\cite{bonchi2022string}, Proposition 3.17]
    \label{prop:pushout-complement}
    A pushout complement of \(K \xrightarrow{i} L \xrightarrow{m} G\) exists
    if and only if it satisfies the no-dangling and no-identification
    conditions.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Rewriting with traced structure}

While in the Frobenius case, all valid pushout complements correspond to a valid
rewrite, this is not the case for the traced monoidal case: for example, a wire
cannot connect the outputs of two boxes together.
In \cite{bonchi2021string}, pushout complements that correspond to a valid
rewrite are identified as \emph{boundary complements}.
Crucially, boundary complements rely on the matching \(L \to G\) being mono.
Restricting to these matchings actually cuts off potential rewrites in the
\emph{traced} setting, such as the occurrence of a rewrite rule inside a loop:
\begin{center}
    \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/matchings/non-mono-matching}
\end{center}
This means that we need a slightly different definition that allows such
rewrites.

\begin{definition}[Traced rewrite candidate]
    Given partial monogamous cospans \(\cospan{i}[a_1]{L}[a_2]{j}\) and
    \(\cospan{m}{G}{n}\), a morphism \(\morph{f}{L}{G}\) is called a
    \emph{traced rewrite candidate} if is injective on vertices and edges not
    in the image of \([a_1,a_2]\).
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    In a traced rewrite candidate, let \(v\) and \(w\) be vertices such that
    \(f(v) = f(w)\).
    Then at least one of \(v\) and \(w\) must be in the image of \(a_1\) and at
    least one must be in the image of \(a_2\).
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        Since the vertices are being merged by \(f\), they must be in the image
        of \(a\) by definition of traced rewrite candidates.
        Assume that \(f(v) = f(w)\) but both vertices are only in the image of
        \(a_1\).
        This would mean that \(v\) and \(w\) both have degree \((0, 1)\) by
        definition of partial monogamous cospans.
        Since \(f\) is injective on edges, this would mean that \(f(a) = f(w)\)
        has degree of at least \((0, 2)\), which violates the partial monogamy
        condition.
        The reverse is the case for if \(v\) and \(w\) are both in the image of
        \(a_2\).
        So at least one of \(v\) and \(w\) must be in the image of \(a_1\) and at
        least one must be in the image of \(a_2\).

        If one o

\begin{definition}[Traced boundary complement]
    \label{def:traced-boundary-complement}
    For partial monogamous cospans \(
        \cospan{i}[a_1]{L}[a_2]{j}
    \) and \(
        \cospan{n}[b_1]{G}[b_2]{m} \in \mathcal{C}
    \), and traced candidate \(
        \morph{f}{L}{G} \in \hypsigma
    \), a pushout complement
    \begin{center}
        \includestandalone{figures/graphs/dpo/boundary-complement}
    \end{center}
    is called a \emph{traced boundary complement} if \(c_1\) and \(c_2\) are
    mono and \(
        \cospan{j+m}[[c_2,d_1]]{\pushoutcomplement{L}}[[d_2,c_1]]{{n+i}}
    \) is a partial monogamous cospan.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:traced-boundary-complement-exists}
    Given partial monogamous cospan \(\cospan{m}[b_1]{G}[b_2]{n}\) and morphisms
    \(
        i + j \xrightarrow{[a_1, a_2]} L \xrightarrow{f} G
    \) satisfying the no-dangling and no-identification conditions where \(f\)
    is a traced candidate, there exists at least one traced boundary complement
    \(C\) as in \cref{def:traced-boundary-complement}.
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        Since the morphisms satisfy the no-dangling and no-identification
        conditions, pushout complements exist: we just need to show that at
        least one of these is a traced boundary complement.

        The pushout complement is constructed by deleting elements of \(L\)
        from \(G\) while retaining the interfaces, i.e.\ the vertices in the
        image of \(a\).
        Since the morphism \(f\) is a traced candidate, it may not be injective
        on these interface vertices, and as such these vertices may also be
        merged or unmerged by \(c\).
        We just need to show that, depending on whether vertices are merged
        by \(a\) or \(f\), there is a pushout complement \(C\) such that
        \(c(v_1)\) and \(c(v_2)\) have degree suitable for the traced boundary
        complement condition.

        First assume vertices \(a_1(v_1), a_2(v_2)\) are not merged by \(a\) but
        are merged by \(f\).
        This means that in the pushout complement \(c_1(v_1) = c_2(v_2)\), as
        otherwise this would not be a pushout.
        Since \(\cospan{i}[a_1]{L}[a_2]{j}\) is partial monogamous, this means
        that \(a_1(v_1)\) has degree \((0,1)\) and \(a_2(v_2)\) has degree
        \((1,0)\); subsequently \(f(a_1(v_1)) = f(a_2(v_2))\) has degree
        \((1,1)\), both of which are contributed by the same edge \(e\).
        By the no-dangling condition the edge must be in the image of \(f\), so
        it is not present in \(C\), so \(c(v_1)\) and \(c(v_2)\) must have
        degree \((0,0)\).
        By partial monogamicity, \(f(a_1(v_1)) = f(a_2(v_2))\) is not in the
        image of \(b\) so \(c(v_1)\) and \(c(v_2)\) cannot be in the image of
        \(d\).
        This means that \(
            \cospan{m+j}{C}{n+i}
        \) is a partial monogamous cospan.

        Conversely, assume vertices \(a_1(v_1) = a_2(v_2)\) are merged by \(a\)
        and not by \(f\).
        This means the pushout does not enforce that \(c_1(v_1) = c_2(v_2)\).
        Pick a pushout complement where \(c_1(v_1) \neq c_2(v_2)\): by
        considering each case it can be seen that this is a valid traced
        boundary complement since the `gap' in between the vertices allows for
        the \(i\) and the \(j\) components of the partial monogamous cospan
        to contribute while keeping the leg mono.

        If a vertex \(v \in G\) is in the image of more than two vertices from
        \(i + j\), this means that there has been merging by both \(a\) and
        \(f\).
        However, note that since \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are mono, \(a\) can only
        merge vertices from \(i\) and \(j\) together, not from both \(i\) and
        \(j\).
        Following the cases above, valid pushout complements have the property
        that any vertices not merged by \(a\) must be merged by \(c\), and
        otherwise they should be split apart.
    \end{proof}
}{
    \begin{proof}[Proof (Sketch)]
        There is always at least one pushout complement by
        \cref{prop:pushout-complement} as the morphisms satisfy the no-dangling
        and no-identification conditions.
        The traced boundary conditions can be found by ensuring any
        vertices merged by \(a\) are not merged by \(c\), and any vertices
        not merged by \(a\) are merged by \(c\).
    \end{proof}
}

\begin{definition}[Traced DPO]
    For morphisms \(G \leftarrow m+n\) and \(H \leftarrow m+n\) in
    \(\hypsigma\), there is a traced rewrite \(G \trgrewrite[\mcr] H\) if there
    exists a rule \(
        \spann{L}{i+j}{G} \in \mcr
    \) and cospan \(
        \cospan{i+j}{C}{n+m} \in \hypsigma
    \) such that diagram in \cref{def:dpo} commutes and \(i+j \to C\) is a
    traced boundary complement.
\end{definition}

Some intuition regarding the construction of traced boundary complements may be
required.
This will be provided by a series of lemmas:

\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:merged-in-traced-complement}
    In a traced boundary complement, if \(
        a_1(v) = a_2(w)
    \), then \(
        c_1(v) = c_2(w)
    \) if and only if \(f(a_1(v) = f(c_2(w)))\) has degree \((0, 0)\) and is
    not in the image of \(b\).
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        For the \(\onlyifdir\) direction, assume that \(c_1(v) = c_2(w)\): let this
        vertex be \(v^\prime\).
        Since (\ref{gat:traced-complement}) is partial monogamous, \([c_2,d_1]\) and
        \([c_1,d_2]\) must be mono, and thus the images of \(c_1\) and \(d_2\) must
        be disjoint, as must the images of \(c_2\) and \(d_1\).
        Therefore \(v^\prime\) cannot be in the image of \(d\); moreover, \(c_1(v)\)
        must have out-degree \(0\) and \(c_2(w)\) must have in-degree \(0\), so
        \(v^\prime\) has degree \((0,0)\).
        Let \(v^{\prime\prime}\) be \(a_1(v) = a_2(w)\): since \(
            \cospan{i}[a_1]{\iltikzfig{strings/rewriting/l}}[a_2]{j}
        \) is a partial monogamous cospan \(v^\prime\) must have degree \((0,0)\).
        Since \(G\) is computed by pushout, \(
            f(v^{\prime\prime}) = g(v^{\prime})
        \) and the degree of this vertex is contributed wholly by \(v^\prime\) and
        \(v^{\prime\prime}\).
        So \(f(a_1(v)) = f(a_2(w))\) also has degree \((0,0)\).

        Now for the \(\ifdir\) direction, assume that \(c_1(v)\) and \(c_2(w)\)
        are not in the image of \(d\), and \(f(a_1(v)) = f(a_2(w))\) has degree
        \((0,0)\).
        Assume that \(c_1(v) \neq c_2(w)\).
        By semi-monogamy of (\ref{gat:traced-complement}), \(c_1(v)\) must have
        degree \((0,1)\) since it is solely in the image of \([d_2, c_1]\).
        But \(f(a_1(v)) = f(a_2(w)) = g(c_1(v)) = g(c_2(w))\), \(c_1(v)\) and
        \(c_2(w)\) must have degree \((0,0)\), a contradiction.
        The same holds for \(c_2(w)\), so \(c_1(v) = c_2(w)\).
    \end{proof}
}{}

Effectively, this means that is vertices are merged by \(a\), the rewrite rule
is looking for \emph{identities} into which one or more edges will be inserted.
This means that for the most part these vertices must be broken apart in the
pushout complement in order to make room for the new edges.
The only time they \emph{cannot} be broken apart is if the matching is into
a closed loop: a vertex with degree \((0, 0)\) that is not in the image of
\(b\).
If this vertex were to be broken apart in the pushout complement, then this
data about the closed loop would be lost.

Loops can also be created when vertices that are not merged in \(L\) are merged
by the matching \(f\).
This data must also be captured by the pushout complement.

\begin{lemma}
    In a traced boundary complement, if \(a_1(v) \neq a_2(w)\) but \(
        f(a_1(v)) = f(a_2(w))
    \), and the degree of \(a_1(v)\) and \(a_2(w)\) is not \((0,0)\), then
    \(c_1(v) = c_2(w)\).
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        Since the diagram is a pushout, if \(a_1(v) \neq a_2(w)\) but \(
            f(a_1(v)) = f(a_2(w))
        \) then vertices must be merged \(c\) to force the latter to the equal.
        Since \(a_1(v)\) and \(a_2(w)\) do not have degree \((0,0)\), they
        have not been merged by \(a\) by partial monogamicity, so there is only
        one choice of map for \([c_1, c_2]\): to merge the vertices together.
    \end{proof}
}{}

The merging of vertices by \(f\) with degree \((0, 0)\) is an important edge
case, as it corresponds to rewriting modulo the \emph{yanking} axiom of traced
categories.
It is this case that yields a \emph{choice} of traced boundary complement,
which unlike regular boundary complements need not be unique.

\begin{example}
    Consider the rule and its interpretation.
    \begin{gather}
        \rrule{
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/rule-lhs}
        }{
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/rule-rhs}
        }
        \qquad
        \raisebox{-2.1em}{\includestandalone{figures/graphs/dpo/non-unique/rule}}
        \label{gath:non-unique-rule}
    \end{gather}

    Now consider the following hypergraph with interface \(
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/g-unlabelled}
        \leftarrow
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/j-unlabelled}
    \).
    There are \emph{two} valid traced boundary complements for the above rule in
    this graph!

    \begin{center}
        \includestandalone{figures/graphs/dpo/non-unique/rewrite-1}
        \includestandalone{figures/graphs/dpo/non-unique/rewrite-2}
    \end{center}

    Both derivations are valid and arise since we are rewriting modulo
    \emph{yanking}:
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-1}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-2}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-3a}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-4a}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-5a}
        \\
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-1}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-2}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-3b}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-4b}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/non-unique/derivation-5b}
    \end{gather*}
\end{example}

When vertices are merged in this way, the choice of traced boundary complement
dictates the position on the yanked wires to apply the rewrite.
Although there are multiple to choose from, there are still properties enforced
by partial monogamy.

\begin{lemma}
    In a traced boundary complement, let \(v \in i\) and
    \(w_0, w_1, \cdots w_k\) such that \(f(a_1(v)) = f(a_2(w_0))\),
    \(f(a_1(v)) = f(a_2(w_1))\) and so on.
    Then either (1) there exists exactly one \(w_l\) such that
    \(c_1(v) = c_2(w_l)\); (2) \(c_1(v)\) is in the image of \(d_1\); or (3)
    \(c_1(v)\) has degree \((1,0)\).

    The same also holds for \(w \in j\), with the interface map as \(d_2\) and
    the degree as \((0,1)\).
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        Since \(c_1(v)\) is in the image of \(c\), it must have either degree
        \((0,0)\) or \((1,0)\) by partial monogamy.
        For it to have degree \((0, 0)\), it must either be in the image of one
        of \(c_2\) or \(d_2\).
        In the case of the former, this means that there must be a \(w_l\) such
        that \(c_1(v) = c_2(w_l)\), and only one such vertex as \(c_2\) is mono,
        so (1) is satisfied.
        In the case of the latter, (2) is immediately satisfied.
        Otherwise, (3) is satisfied.

        The proof for the flipped case is exactly the same.
    \end{proof}
}{}

Rewriting modulo yanking also eliminates another foible of rewriting modulo
(non-traced) symmetric monoidal structure.
In the latter, matchings must be \emph{convex}: there cannot be a path from the
outputs of a match back to its inputs.
However, in the traced case this is not necessary, as this example from
\cite{bonchi2021string} will show.

\begin{example}
    Consider the following rewrite rule and its interpretation.
    %
    \begin{gather}
        \rrule{
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/example-l}
        }{
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/example-r}
        }
        \qquad
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/example-rule-graph}
        \label{gath:convex-rule}
    \end{gather}
    %
    Now consider the following term and interpretation:
    %
    \begin{gather}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/example-g}
        \qquad
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/example-g-graph}
        \label{gath:convex-term}
    \end{gather}
    Although it is not obvious in the original string diagram, there is in fact
    a matching of (\ref{gath:convex-rule}) in (\ref{gath:convex-term}).
    Performing the DPO procedure yields the following:
    %
    \begin{gather}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/example-h-graph}
        \qquad
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/example-h}
    \end{gather}
    In a non-traced setting this is an invalid rule!
    However, it is possible with yanking.
    \begin{gather*}
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/example-g}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/rewrite-2}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/rewrite-4}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/rewrite-5}
        =
        \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/convex/example-h}
    \end{gather*}
\end{example}

We are almost ready to show the soundness and completeness of this DPO rewriting
system.
The final prerequisite is a decomposition lemma, akin to a similar result
in~\cite{bonchi2022string} for the symmetric monoidal case.

\begin{lemma}[Traced decomposition]\label{lem:decomposition}
    Given partial monogamous cospans \(\cospan{m}[p_1]{G}[p_2]{n}\) and \(
        \cospan{i}[a_1]{L}[a_2]{j}
    \), along with a morphism \(
        L \xrightarrow{f} G
    \) such that \(i+j \rightarrow L \rightarrow G\) satisfies the no-dangling
    and no-identification condition, then \(
        \cospan{m}[p_1]{G}[p_2]{n}
    \) can be factored as
    \begin{gather}
        \trace{i}{
            \begin{array}{cc}
                \cospan{i}[a_1]{L}[a_2]{j} \\

            \cospan{j+m}{C}{i+n}
        }
        \label{gath:decomposition}
    \end{gather}
    where all cospans are partial monogamous and \(C\) is a traced boundary
    complement.
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        Let \(C\) be defined as a traced boundary complement of \(

            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/ctilde} &:= \cospan{i+j}{C}{m+n} \\
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/ghat} &:= \cospan{m}{G}{n}
            &
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/gtilde} &:= \cospan{0}{G}{m+n}
        \end{align*}
        By using the compact closed structure of \(\cspfihyp\), we also have that \(
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/ltilde} = \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/lhat-bent}
        \), \(
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/ctilde} = \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/chat-bent}
        \) and \(
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/gtilde} = \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/ghat-bent}
        \).
        Since \(
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/gtilde} = \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/lctilde}
        \), it follows that \(
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/ghat-bent} = \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/lchat-bent}
        \) and subsequently \(
            \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/ghat} = \iltikzfig{graphs/dpo/lchat}
        \).
        The `loop' is constructed in the same manner as the canonical trace on
        \(\cspfihyp\), so this is a term in the form of (\ref{gath:decomposition}).
        Moreover, all cospans involved are partial monogamous by definition of
        rewrite rules and traced boundary complements.

        Define the following cospans:

            \cospan{0}{L}{i+j}
            &:=

        By functoriality, since \(

            =
            \iltikzfig{strings/rewriting/l-folded}
            \seq
            \iltikzfig{strings/rewriting/c-folded}
        \) then \[
            \cospan{0}{G}{m+n} = \cospan{0}{L}{i+j} \seq \cospan{i+j}{C}{m+n}.
        \]
        Cospan composition is pushout, so \(\cospan{L}{G}{C}\) is a pushout.
        Using the same reasoning, \(\cospan{R}{G}{C}\) is also a pushout: this gives
        us the DPO diagram.
        All that remains is to check that the aforementioned pushouts are traced
        boundary complements: this follows by inspecting components.

        Now the \(\ifdir\) direction: assume we have a DPO diagram (\ref{gath:dpo})
        where \(L \leftarrow i + j\), \(i + j \rightarrow R\), \(m + n \to G\) and
        \(m + n \to H\) are defined as in (\ref{gath:l-cospan}-\ref{gath:h-cospan})
        above.
        We must show that \(
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[f][white]
            =
            \iltikzfig{strings/rewriting/rewrite-l}
        \) and \(
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[H][white]
            =
            \iltikzfig{strings/rewriting/rewrite-r}
        \).
        By definition of traced boundary complement \(\cospan{j+m}{C}{i+n}\) is a
        partial monogamous cospan, so by fullness of \(\termandfrobtohypsigma\),
        there exists a term \(
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-2}[c][white][j][m][i][n]
            \in \stmcsigma
        \) such that \(
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-2}[c][white]
            =
            \cospan{j+m}{C}{i+n}
        \).
        By traced decomposition (\cref{lem:decomposition}), we have that for any
        traced boundary complement \(\cospan{i+j}{C}{m+n}\) and morphism
        \(L \to G\), \(\cospan{m}{G}{n}\) can be factored as in
        (\ref{gath:decomposition}), i.e.\ \[
            \termandfrobtohypsigma[\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[f][white]]
            =
            \trace{j}{\termandfrobtohypsigma[\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[l][white]]
            \tensor
            \id[n]
            \seq
            \termandfrobtohypsigma[\iltikzfig{strings/category/f-2-2}[c][white]]}.
        \]
        So by functoriality, we have that \(
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[f][white]
            =
            \iltikzfig{strings/rewriting/rewrite-l}
        \).
        The same reasoning follows for \(
            \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[H][white]
            =
            \iltikzfig{strings/rewriting/rewrite-r}
        \).

\subsection{Rewriting with traced comonoid structure}

To extend rewriting with traced structure to the comonoid case, the traced
boundary complement conditions need to be weakened to the case of
\emph{left}-monogamous cospans.

\begin{definition}[Traced left-boundary complement]
    \label{def:traced-left-boundary-complement}
    For partial left-monogamous cospans \(
        \cospan{i}[a_1]{L}[a_2]{j}
    \) and \(
        \cospan{n}[b_1]{G}[b_2]{m} \in \mathcal{C}
    \) and traced candidate \(
        \morph{f}{L}{G} \in \hypsigma
    \), a pushout complement as in \cref{def:traced-boundary-complement}
    is called a \emph{traced left-boundary complement} if \(c_1\) and \(c_2\)
    are mono and \(
        \cospan{j+m}[[c_2,d_1]]{\pushoutcomplement{L}}[[d_2,c_1]]{{n+i}}
    \) is a partial left-monogamous cospan.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
    Given partial left-monogamous cospan \(\cospan{m}[b_1]{G}[b_2]{n}\) and
    morphisms \(
        i + j \xrightarrow{[a_1, a_2]} L \xrightarrow{f} G
    \) satisfying the no-dangling and no-identification conditions where \(f\)
    is a traced candidate, there exists at least one traced left-boundary
    complement \(C\) as in \cref{def:traced-boundary-complement}.
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        The strategy is similar to that of
        \cref{lem:traced-boundary-complement-exists}: we just need to be aware
        that \(a_2\) may not be mono.
        For the case when \(a_2(v) = a_2(w)\), \(c_1(v) \neq c_2(w)\) as this
        would mean that \(j + m \to C\) would not be mono, violating the
        the partial left-monogamy condition.
    \end{proof}
}{
    \begin{proof}[Proof (Sketch)]
        Similar to \cref{lem:traced-boundary-complement-exists}, except that
        \(a_2\) may not be mono.
        When \(a_2(v) = a_2(w)\), \(c_1(v) \neq c_2(w)\) as this
        would mean that \(j + m \to C\) would not be mono.
    \end{proof}
