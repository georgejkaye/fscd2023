\section{Hypergraphs for traced categories}

We wish to use the hypergraph framework for a setting with a \emph{trace}.

\begin{definition}[\cite{joyal1996traced,hasegawa2009traced}]
    A \emph{symmetric traced monoidal category} (STMC) is a symmetric monoidal
    category \(\mathbf{C}\) equipped with functions \(
        \morph{
            \trace{X}[A][B]{-}
        }{
            \mathbf{C}(X \tensor A, X \tensor B)
        }{
            \mathbf{C}(X, Y)
        }
    \) for any objects \(A,B\) and \(X\) satisfying the axioms of STMCs listed
    in \cref{app:equations}, \cref{fig:stmc-axioms}.
\end{definition}

In the string diagram notation, the trace is represented by joining some of the
inputs of a circuit to its outputs.
%
\begin{center}
    \(
        \trace{X}[A][B]{\iltikzfig{strings/traced/trace-lhs}[F][comb][X][A][B]}
        \xrightarrow{\text{def}}
        \iltikzfig{strings/traced/trace-rhs}[F][comb][A][B]
    \)
\end{center}

The category of interfaced hypergraphs we have just defined already
contains the structure necessary to define a trace.

\iftoggle{conf}{}{
    \begin{definition}[Hypergraph category \cite{fong2019hypergraph}]
        A \emph{hypergraph category} is a symmetric monoidal category in which each
        object \(X\) is equipped with a Frobenius structure.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:frobenius-map}
        \(\cspdhyp\) is a hypergraph category.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        The Frobenius structure is defined as follows:
        \begin{gather*}
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/merge}[white]
            :=
            \cospan{m + m}{m}{m}
            \quad
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/init}[white]
            :=
            \cospan{0}{m}{m}
            \\
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/copy}[white]
            :=
            \cospan{m}{m}{m+m}
            \quad
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/discard}[white]
            :=
            \cospan{m}{m}{0}
        \end{gather*}
    \end{proof}
    \begin{corollary}[\cite{bonchi2022string}]
        \(\cspdhyp\) is compact closed.
    \end{corollary}
}{
    \begin{proposition}[\cite{carboni1987cartesian,bonchi2022string}]\label{prop:frobenius-map}
        \(\cspdhyp\) is compact closed.
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        A Frobenius structure can be defined on \(\cspdhyp\) as follows:
        \begin{gather*}
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/merge}[white]
            :=
            \cospan{m + m}{m}{m}
            \quad
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/init}[white]
            :=
            \cospan{0}{m}{m}
            \\
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/copy}[white]
            :=
            \cospan{m}{m}{m+m}
            \quad
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/discard}[white]
            :=
            \cospan{m}{m}{0}
        \end{gather*}
        Then a cup can be constructed as \(
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/init}[white]
            \seq
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/copy}[white]
        \) and a cap as \(
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/discard}[white]
            \seq
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/merge}[white]
        \).
    \end{proof}
}

It is well known that every compact closed category is equipped with a
\emph{canonical trace}~\cite{joyal1996traced}, constructed by combining the cup,
cap and an identity, so \(\cspfihyp\) is already traced.

\begin{definition}[Canonical trace]
    Given a cospan \(\cospan{x+m}{F}{x+n} \in \cspdhyp\), its trace on \(x\) is
    defined as \[
        \begin{array}{cc}
            \cospan{0}{x}{x} \seq \cospan{x}{x}{x+x} \\
            \tensor \\
            \cospan{m}{m}{m}
        \end{array}
        \seq
        \begin{array}{cc}
            \cospan{x}{x}{x} \\
            \tensor \\
            \cospan{x+m}{F}{x+n}
        \end{array}
        \seq
        \begin{array}{cc}
            \cospan{x+x}{x}{x} \seq \cospan{x}{x}{0} \\
            \tensor \\
            \cospan{n}{n}{n}
        \end{array}.
    \]
\end{definition}

However, we must be cautious as there are terms in a compact closed category
which are not valid traced terms, such as those where outputs of generators are
connected to outputs.
In the next section we will confirm that computing the trace in this way does
not lead to any degeneracies.

\subsection{Monogamy}

In~\cite{bonchi2016rewriting}, it is shown that terms in a (non-traced)
symmetric monoidal category are interpreted as a certain sub-prop of
\(\cspdhyp\), in which all hypergraphs are \emph{acyclic}.
Clearly, to model trace this condition must be dropped.

However, there is also another condition known as \emph{monogamy}: informally,
this means that every vertex has exactly one `in' and `out' connection, be it to
an edge or an interface.
For the most part, this condition also applies to the traced case: wires cannot
arbitrarily fork and join.
There is one nuance: the trace of the identity.
This is depicted as a closed loop \(
    \trace{1}{\iltikzfig{strings/category/identity}[white]}
    =
    \iltikzfig{strings/traced/trace-id}
\), and one might think that it can be discarded, i.e. \(
    \iltikzfig{strings/traced/trace-id}
    =
    \iltikzfig{strings/monoidal/empty}
\).
This is \emph{not} always the case, such as in the category of finite
dimensional vector spaces~\cite[Sec. 6.1]{hasegawa1997recursion}.
Closed loops must therefore be represented in the hypergraph framework:
there is a natural representation of such a loop as a lone vertex disconnected
from either interface.

\begin{definition}
    For a hypergraph \(H \in \hyp\), the \emph{degree} of a vertex
    \(v \in \vertices{H}\) is a tuple \((i,o)\) where \(i\) is the number of
    pairs \((e,i)\) where \(e\) is a hyperedge with \(v\) as its \(i\)th target,
    and \(o\) is similarly the number of pairs \((e,j)\) where \(e\) is a
    hyperedge with \(v\) as its \(j\)th target.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    For a cospan \(\cospan{m}[f]{H}[g]{n}\), we say it is
    \emph{partial monogamous} if \(f\) and \(g\) are mono and, for all nodes
    \(v \in H_\star\), the degree of \(v\) is

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{rlcrl}

            &
            \((0,0)\)

            &
            otherwise

        image of \(f\) is not in the image of \(h \seq p\), and similarly any vertex

            Since this is a partial monogamous cospan, the images of \(f\) and \(h\)

            Therefore, \(f(v)\) is not in the image of \(h\), so it cannot be in the

\begin{lemma}~\label{lem:partial monogamous-ops}
    Let \(\cospan{m}{F}{n}\), \(\cospan{n}{G}{p}\), \(\cospan{p}{H}{q}\) and
    \(\cospan{x+m}{K}{x+n}\) be partial monogamous cospans.
    Then,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identities and symmetries are partial monogamous.
        \item \(\cospan{m}{F}{n} \seq \cospan{n}{G}{p}\) is partial monogamous.
        \item \(\cospan{m}{F}{n} \tensor \cospan{p}{H}{q}\) is partial
                monogamous.
        \item \(\trace{x}{\cospan{x+m}{K}{x+n}} \) is partial monogamous.
    \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        Since any monogamous hypergraph is also partial monogamous, the first
        three points hold due to~\cite[Prop.16]{bonchi2022string}, dropping the
        acyclicity condition.
        For the final condition, consider the image of \(f\) and \(g\).
        For each \(i \in x\), there are two cases to consider: \(f(i) = g(i)\)
        and \(f(i) \neq g(i)\).

        In the former, the degree of \(v^\prime = f(v) = h(v)\) must be
        \((0,0)\) by definition of semi-monogamicity.
        Therefore in the traced hypergraph \(
            \cospan{m}[g \seq p]{K^\prime}[h \seq p]{n}
        \), \(v^\prime\) will still have degree \((0,0)\), and will not be in
        the image of \(g \seq p\) or \(h \seq p\) by \cref{lem:trace-interface}.
        So the cospan is partial monogamous.

        In the latter case, \(f(i)\) must have degree of \((0,0)\) if it in the
        image of \(k\) or \((0,1)\) otherwise.
        Similarly \(g(i)\) either has degree \((0,0)\) or \((1,0)\).
        Let \(v := p(f(i)) = p(g(i))\); we now consider the degree of \(v\)
        computed using \cref{lem:trace-degree}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If \(f(i)\) is in the image of \(k\) and \(g(i)\) is in the
                    image of \(h\), then \(v\) has degree \((0,0)\).
                    \(v\) is in the image of \(h \seq p\) and \(h \seq p\), so
                    the cospan is partial monogamous.
            \item If \(f(i)\) is in the image of \(k\), then \(v\) has degree
                    \((1, 0)\); since \(v\) is in the image of \(k \seq p\), the
                    cospan is partial monogamous.
            \item If \(g(i)\) is in the image of \(h\), then \(v\) has degree
                    \((0, 1)\); since \(v\) is in the image of \(h \seq p\), the
                    cospan is partial monogamous.
            \item Otherwise, \(v\) will have degree \((1, 1)\), and is not in
                    the image of either interface so the cospan is partial
                    monogamous.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{proof}
}{}

\noindent
This means that the partial monogamous hypergraphs form a sub-prop of
\(\cspdhyp\), which we name \(\pmcspdhyp\).
Crucially, while we step outside \(\pmcspdhyp\) in order to construct
the trace by composing the cup and cap, we always step back before finishing,
so the construction is not degenerate.

\subsection{From terms to graphs}

For \(\pmcspfihyp\) to be suitable for reasoning with traced categories, it must
be \emph{sound and complete}: there must be a two-way correspondence between
terms in a traced monoidal theory and interfaced hypergraphs.

\begin{definition}
    For a SMT \((\generators,\equations)\), let
    \(\stmc{\generators}\) be the STMC freely generated over the
    generators in \(\generators\).
    Let \(\stmc{\generators, \equations}\) be \(\stmc{\generators}\) quotiented
    by equations in \(\equations\).
\end{definition}

A \emph{(traced) prop morphism} is a strict (traced) symmetric monoidal functor
between props.
Since \(\stmc{\Sigma}\) and \(\pmcspdhyp\) are freely generated, to define a
prop morphism between them it suffices to define it on the generators in the
former.
Moreover, since \(\pmcspdhyp\) is a sub-prop of \(\cspdhyp\), we can simply
use the construction for the Frobenius case.

\begin{definition}[\cite{bonchi2022string}]
    Let \(\morph{\termtohyp{\Sigma}^\mathbf{S}}{\smc{\Sigma}}{\cspdhyp}\) be a prop
    morphism defined on the generators of \(\Sigma\) as shown in
    \cref{fig:termtohyp}.
    \begin{figure}
        \begin{gather*}
            \termtohyp[\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[\phi][white][m][n]]{\Sigma}
            :=
            \iltikzfig{graphs/terms/generator}
            \quad
            \termtohyp[\iltikzfig{strings/category/identity}[white][m][n]]{\Sigma}
            :=
            \iltikzfig{graphs/terms/identity}[white]
            \\[1em]
            \termtohyp[\iltikzfig{strings/symmetric/symmetry}[white][m][n]]{\Sigma}
            :=
            \iltikzfig{graphs/terms/symmetry}[white]
        \end{gather*}
        \caption{Definition of \(\termtohyp{\Sigma}\) on generators in \(\smc{\Sigma}\).}
        \label{fig:termtohyp}
    \end{figure}

    Let \(\morph{\frobtohyp{\Sigma}}{\frob}{\cspdhyp}\) be a prop morphism
    defined as illustrated in \cref{prop:frobenius-map}.

    Then, let \(\morph{\termandfrobtohypsigma}{\smc{\Sigma} + \frob}{\cspdhyp}\)
    be the copairing \(\termtohyp{\Sigma} + \frobtohyp{\Sigma}\).
\end{definition}

We can exploit the interplay between compact closed and traced categories in
order to use these existing prop morphisms

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:smc-core}
    Let \(\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[F][white]\) be a term in
    \(\stmc{\Sigma}\).
    Then there exists \(
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[G][white][x][m][x][n] \in \smc{\Sigma}
    \) such that \(
        \trace{}{\termtohyp{\Sigma}[\iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[F^\prime][white]]}
        =
        \iltikzfig{strings/category/f}[G][white]
    \).
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        Any trace can be made a `global trace' by applying \eqref{eq:tightening}
        and \eqref{eq:superposing}.
    \end{proof}
}{}

\begin{proposition}
    There exists a faithful embedding \(
        \morph{ct}{\stmc{\Sigma}}{\smc{\Sigma} + \frob}
    \).
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    First \cref{lem:smc-core} can be used to isolate a term in \(\smc{\Sigma}\).
    Then, the corresponding term in \(\smc{\Sigma} + \frob\) can be read as
    the canonical trace as defined in \cref{thm:canonical-trace} on top of this
    term.
\end{proof}

\iftoggle{conf}{}{
    Recall one of the key theorems from~\cite{bonchi2021string}.

    \begin{theorem}[\cite{bonchi2021string}, Corollary 20]\label{thm:smc-graph-iso}
        \(\smc{\Sigma} \cong \macspfihyp\).
    \end{theorem}
}

Our goal is to extend the results of \cite{bonchi2021string} to terms in
\(\stmcsigma\) and \emph{partial monogamous hypergraphs}.
We first characterise the image of \(\termtohypsigma\) and show that it is
exactly \(\pmcspfihyp\).
Before progressing to the main theorem, we must show a result about terms in
\(\smc{}\), i.e.\ terms constructed from just symmetries and identities.

In particular, there is a correspondence between \(\smc{}\) and
\emph{bijective} functions.

\begin{definition}
    Let \(\perms\) be the subprop of \(\finset\) containing only the
    bijective functions.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:symmetries-prop}
    \(\smc{} \cong \perms\).
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        The morphism \(\morph{\phi}{\smc{}}{\perms}\) is defined over
        generators in \(\smc{}\) as \[
            \phi(\iltikzfig{strings/monoidal/empty}) = \{\}
            \quad
            \phi(\iltikzfig{strings/category/identity}[white])
            =
            \{0 \mapsto 0\}
            \quad
            \phi(\iltikzfig{strings/symmetric/symmetry}[white])
            =
            \{0 \mapsto 1, 1 \mapsto 0\}
        \]
        Since any term in \(\smc{}\) can be expressed using these generators,
        this defines the complete transformation.

        The reverse morphism \(\morph{\psi}{\finset}{\smc{}}\) is inductively
        over the size of \(m\).
        For the base case \(\morph{f}{[0]}{[0]}\), let \(
            \phi(f) := \iltikzfig{strings/monoidal/empty}
        \).
        For \(
            \morph{f}{[k+1]}{[k+1]}
        \), let \(i\) such that \(f(i) = k+1\), and define the function \(
            \morph{f^\prime}{\nat_{k}}{\nat_{k}}
        \) as the function such that \(
            f^\prime(j) = f(j)
        \) if \(j < i\), and \(f(j+1)\) otherwise.
        Then \[
            \psi(f) := \iltikzfig{strings/symmetric/f-construction}.
        \]

        \noindent
        These are shown to be inverses by a simple induction in both directions.
    \end{proof}
}{}

This allows us to establish a correspondence between terms in \(\smc{}\)
and cospans of discrete hypergraphs.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:monog-discrete-cospan}
    Given a monogamous cospan \(\cospan{m}[f]{m}[g]{m}\), there exists a unique
    term \(\morph{h}{m}{m} \in \smc{}\) up to the axioms of SMCs such that
    \(\termtohyp[h]{\Sigma} = \cospan{m}[f]{m}[g]{m}\).
\end{lemma}
\iftoggle{proofs}{
    \begin{proof}
        Since the cospan is monogamous, \(f\) and \(g\) are mono.
        As the cospan is also discrete, there exists a (unique) bijective
        function \(\morph{h^\prime}{[m]}{[m]}\) such that \(h^\prime(i) = j\) if
        \(f(i) = g(j)\).
        By \cref{lem:symmetries-prop}, there is a corresponding term
        \(h \in \smc{}\) that is unique up to SMC axioms: a simple induction
        shows that \(\termtohyp[h]{\Sigma} = \cospan{m}[f]{m}[g]{m}\).
    \end{proof}
}{}

We now proceed to the first main result.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:termtohyp-image}
    A cospan \(\cospan{m}{F}{n}\) is in the image of \(
        \termandfrobtohypsigma{\Sigma} \circ ct\) if
    and only if it is partial monogamous.

    \begin{proof}[Proof (Sketch)]
        The \(\onlyifdir\) direction is by induction on the structure of the term.
        For the \(\ifdir\) direction, a cospan isomorphic to the original
        cospan can be constructed from which a term in \(\stmcsigma\) can be
        read off.
        Informally, this cospan is
        \begin{gather}
            \trace{}{
                \cospan{x + m}{V}{x + n}
                \seq
                \cospan{x + n}{L + E + n}{x + n}
            }
        \end{gather}
        where \(V\) is all the vertices in \(F\), \(L\) is the vertices with
        degree \((0, 0)\) not in the image of the interfaces, and \(E\) is the
        all the hyperedges in \(F\).
        The morphisms then connect the components appropriately.
        The first component corresponds to a term in \(\smc{}\) by
        \cref{lem:symmetries-prop}, and the stack of edges to a tensor of
        generators in \(\stmc{\Sigma}\).
    \end{proof}
