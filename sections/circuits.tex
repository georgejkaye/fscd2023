\subsection{Digital circuits}
\label{sec:digital-circuits}

As mentioned above, traced Cartesian categories are useful for reasoning in
settings with fixpoint operators.
One such setting is that of \emph{digital circuits} built from primitive logic
gates: in \cite{ghica2023compositional}, digital circuits are modelled as
morphisms in a STMC.
Here, the trace models a feedback loop, and the comonoid structure represents
forking wires.
The semantics of digital circuits can be expressed as a monoidal
theory~\cite[Sec. 6]{ghica2023compositional}.

\begin{definition}[Gate-level circuits]
    Let the monoidal theory of \emph{gate-level sequential circuits} be defined
    as \(
        (\generators[\mathbf{SCirc}], \equations[\mathbf{SCirc}])
    \), where \[
        \generators[\mathbf{SCirc}]
        :=
        \{
            \iltikzfig{circuits/components/gates/and},
            \iltikzfig{circuits/components/gates/or},
            \iltikzfig{circuits/components/gates/not},
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/init}[comb]
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/copy}[comb],
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/monoid/merge}[comb],
            \iltikzfig{strings/structure/comonoid/discard}[comb],
            \iltikzfig{circuits/components/values/v}[\belnaptrue],
            \iltikzfig{circuits/components/values/v}[\belnapfalse],
            \iltikzfig{circuits/components/values/v}[\belnapboth],
            \iltikzfig{circuits/components/waveforms/delay}
        \}
    \] and the equations of \(
        \equations[\mathbf{SCirc}]
    \) are listed in
    \cref{fig:monoid-equations,fig:comonoid-equations,fig:bialgebra-equations,fig:circuit-equations},
    where
    \(
        \gateinterpretation
    \) maps gates to the corresponding truth table, \(\ljoin\) is the join in a
    lattice structure on \(\{\bullet, \belnaptrue, \belnapfalse, \belnapboth\}\),
    and \(
        \iltikzfig{circuits/components/circuits/f-1-2}[F^n][comb][m][x][n]
    \) is defined inductively as \(
        \iltikzfig{circuits/instant-feedback/f0-box}
        :=
        \iltikzfig{circuits/instant-feedback/f0-definition}
    \) and \(
        \iltikzfig{circuits/instant-feedback/fkp1-box}
        :=
        \iltikzfig{circuits/instant-feedback/fkp1-definition}
    \).
\end{definition}

The generators in \(\generators[\mathbf{SCirc}]\) are, respectively:
\(\andgate\), \(\orgate\) and \(\notgate\) gates; constructs for introducing,
forking, joining and stubbing wires; \emph{values} representing a true signal,
a false signal, and both signals at once; and a delay of one unit of time.
Note that while the equations in \(\equations[\mathbf{Scirc}]\) contain those
of a commutative comonoid, they do \emph{not} explicitly contain the general
Cartesian equations: instead, these are derived from smaller equations.

Using graph rewriting, we can sketch out an \emph{operational semantics} for
sequential circuits.
For the interests of brevity, we will only consider circuits of the form \(
    \iltikzfig{circuits/productivity/mealy-form-verbose}[F][v][m][n]
\): circuits with no `non-delay-guarded feedback' in which the registers of the
circuit have been isolated from a core containing only `blue'
(\emph{combinational}) components, which models a function.
Any sequential circuit can be translated into such a form by the equational
theory.

We can `apply' such a circuit to an input as shown in the left-hand side of
\cref{fig:cycle}; the equations in
\(\equations[\mathbf{SCirc}]\) can be used to derive the right-hand side.
The four equations in the top row of \cref{fig:circuit-equations} can then be
repeatedly applied to reduce the two `new' cores down to values, representing
the output and new state of the circuit.

When the circuits are interpreted as hypergraphs and the equations as rewrites,
a computer could perform this sequence of rewrites in order to evaluate circuits
in a step-by-step manner.
