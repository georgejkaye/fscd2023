    \begin{abstract}
        In this paper we adapt previous work on rewriting string diagrams using
        hypergraphs to the case where the underlying category has a
        \emph{traced comonoid structure}, in which wires can be forked and
        the outputs of a morphism can be connected to its input.
        Such a structure is particularly interesting because any traced
        Cartesian (dataflow) category has an underlying traced comonoid
        structure.
        We show that certain subclasses of hypergraphs are fully complete
        for traced comonoid categories: that is to say, every term in such a
        category has a unique corresponding hypergraph up to isomorphism, and
        from every hypergraph with the desired properties, a unique term in the
        category can be retrieved up to the axioms of traced comonoid
        categories.
        We also show how the framework of double pushout rewriting (DPO) can be
        adapted for traced comonoid categories by characterising the valid
        pushout complements for rewriting in our setting.
        We conclude by presenting a case study in the form of recent work on
        an equational theory for \emph{sequential circuits}: circuits built from
        primitive logic gates with delay and feedback.
        The graph rewriting framework allows for the definition of an
        \emph{operational semantics} for sequential circuits.
