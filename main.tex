\title{Graph rewriting for digital circuits}

\begin{document}

    \begin{abstract}
        Sequential circuits are circuits with feedback and delay constructed
        from primitive logic gates.
        There has been recent work into developing an \emph{equational theory}
        for sequential circuits using \emph{string diagrams}, giving an
        intuitive graphical framework for comparing and evaluating circuits.
        However, while they are suitable for pen-and-paper reasoning, string
        diagrams are not an efficient data structure for reasoning
        computationally.
        In this paper we extend previous work on rewriting string diagrams using
        \emph{hypergraphs} to solve this problem, by considering the case when
        the underlying category has a traced comonoid structure, both features
        of the category of sequential circuits.
        We show that certain subclasses of hypergraphs are sound and complete
        for traced comonoid categories: that is to say, every term in such a
        category has a unique corresponding hypergraph up to isomorphism, and
        from every hypergraph with the desired properties, a unique term in the
        category can be retrieved up to the axioms of traced comonoid
        categories.
        We also show how the framework of double pushout rewriting (DPO) can be
        adapted for traced comonoid categories by characterising the valid
        pushout complements for rewriting in our setting.
        Finally, we conclude by demonstrating how an operational semantics for
        sequential circuits can be implemented using the previously developed
        equational theory and graph rewriting.
